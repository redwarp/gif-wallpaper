## Inspiration

This app was created because I wanted to display as a wallpaper the animated ninja turtles of
Alex Redfish. [Check their art](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/5wm5W), it is dope.

## Translations

You want to help with translations? You find your language missing and want to help?
That is awesome!
I use the website **POEditor** to handle translations. They are free for open source project and easy to use, and provide synchronisation with GitHub. So follow [this link to join the translations project](https://poeditor.com/join/project?hash=QaDkuFZTp2).

### Steps when adding a new language

* Edit the [`config.json`](fetch-translations) file in the `fetch-translations` folder to add the new language, and map the POEditor values with Android's value folder, and fastlane supported language list.
* Run `cargo run --bin fetch-translations`, verify that a new strings.xml files was created in the Android project.
* Run `cargo run --bin update-fastlane`, verify that new metadata files were added in the fastlane folder.
* Edit the [`app/build.gradle`](app/build.gradle) file and add to the res config the new language code.
* Run the app in an emulator or device set on the chosen language, verify it shows properly, and take the 5 screenshots needed for fastlane. At some point, I should automate that with Picasso, but we are not there yet.
