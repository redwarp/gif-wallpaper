## Help with the translations

You want to help translating this app? You find your language missing and want to help?
That is awesome!
I use the website **POEditor** to handle translations. They are free for open source project and easy to use, and provide synchronisation with GitHub. So follow [this link to join the translations project](https://poeditor.com/join/project?hash=QaDkuFZTp2).

## Attribution

* Rocket found on [cliply](https://cliply.co/clip/rocket-icon/), a royalty free gif website
* App icon loosely (like, really loosely) inspired by an icon from Kshitij Bhardwaj on [the Noon project](https://thenounproject.com/search/?q=wallpaper&i=92484).
