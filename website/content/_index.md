## Help with the translations

You want to help translate this app? You find your language missing and want to help?
That is awesome!
I use the website **POEditor** to handle translations. They are free for open source projects, easy to use, and provide synchronisation with GitHub. So follow [this link to join the translation project](https://poeditor.com/join/project?hash=QaDkuFZTp2).

## Attribution

* The Rocket image was discovered on [Cliply](https://cliply.co/clip/rocket-icon/), a website that provides royalty-free gifs.
* The App icon loosely based on an icon created by Kshitij Bhardwaj for the [Noun project](https://thenounproject.com/search/?q=wallpaper&i=92484).
